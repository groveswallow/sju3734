Using luciferase as the reporter of VEGF promoter activity, we found that wt p53 inhibited VEGF promoter activity in SKLMS-1 cells. Deletion analysis defined an 87-bp region (bp -135 to -48) in the VEGF promoter that is necessary for inhibiting VEGF promoter activity by wt p53.

Additionally, Twist1 depletion led to down-regulation of mesenchymal markers and up-regulation of epithelial markers in SS cell lines.  Moreover, Twist1 knock-down profoundly inhibited the growth of synovial sarcoma xenograft in nude mice compared to controls indicating that Twist1 is essential for tumor initiating cell properties. Finally, depletion of SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein by RNA inference induced down-regulation of Twist1, implying that Twist1 is regulated by SS18-SSX.','Twist1 is essential in maintaining mesenchymal state and tumor-initiating properties in synovial sarcoma.'),(16766266,'MITF','targeted by','EWS-ATF1 fusion protein','positive','clear cell sarcoma; CCS surviv','We show that EWS-ATF1 occupies the MITF promoter, mimicking melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) signaling to induce expression of MITF, the melanocytic master transcription factor and an amplified oncogene in melanoma.

Inhibition of RNR in Ewing sarcoma cells caused apoptosis in vitro and attenuated tumor growth in an in vivo, xenograft model. Additionally, we discovered that the sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cells to inhibition or suppression of RNR is mediated, in part, by high levels of SLFN11, a protein that sensitizes cells to DNA damage.','Gene expression signature based screening identifies ribonucleotide reductase as a candidate therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma.'),(30106161,'HES1; HEY1','targeted by','miR‑34b','negative','N/A','The results indicated that Notch1 and its target genes, Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 and Hes‑related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, were suppressed by miR‑34b directly.
